Recovery Plan:
--------------

1. Stop All Write Access: Immediately cease all write access to the server to prevent further loss or security issues.
  
2. Isolate the Server: Disconnect the affected server from the network to prevent unauthorized access.
  
3. Assess Backup Availability: Check if there are recent backups with the deleted file. If found, restore it carefully without losing any recent changes.
  
4. Use File Recovery Tools: Try using special tools to recover the deleted file from the server's storage.
  
5. Verify Recovered File: Make sure the recovered file has all the needed credentials and isn't damaged.
  
6. Test Access and Functionality: Check if the restored file works well without causing any problems.

7. In case of EC2, if your pem key is deleted, you can login through cloudshell and perform necessary actions.
